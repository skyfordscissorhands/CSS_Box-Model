        <p>Wes Anderson's stop-motion animated adaptation of Fantastic Mr Fox featured George Clooney as "Foxy"
            Mr Fox is clever. Far too clever for his local farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Still, even a very clever
            and cunning fox sometimes gets caught out - and when those devious farmers finally locate the whereabouts of
            Mr Fox's home, it puts him and his family in danger.
            But Mr Fox is never beaten - and by trapping him and his family inside their foxhole, it looks like Boggis,
            Bunce and Bean might have accidentally shot themselves in the foot instead...
